abstract = "The real-time modeling of large systems of spiking neurons is computationally very demanding in terms of processing power, synaptic weight memory requirements and communication throughput. We propose to build a highperformance computer for this purpose with a multicast communications infrastructure inspired by neurobiology. The core component will be a chip multiprocessor incorporating some tens of small embedded processors, interconnected by an NoC that carries spike events between processors on the same or different chips. The design emphasizes modeling flexibility, power-efficiency, and fault-tolerance, and is intended to yield a general-purpose platform for the real-time simulation of largescale spiking neural systems.",
