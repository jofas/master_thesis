Discussion
----------

This meeting mostly concerned itself with the Covid-19 situation and
how it influences the work on my dissertation.
The main aspect which we had to clearify was my access to SpiNNaker.
Alan asked Professor Steve Furber (offical owner of the board
allocated for the dissertation) if I could leave the premise with the
board.
Professor Furber said that it would be possible for me to take the
board.
With SpiNNaker access the dissertation project can continue as
planned.
Skype or some other tool will be used to replace face-to-face
meetings.

We also shortly discussed my second draft of the report.
At this point Caoimhín already provided me with his feedback.
Alan and Kevin have yet to read the second draft.
