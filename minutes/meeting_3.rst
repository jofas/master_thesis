Discussion
----------

This meeting was a last dry run of my presentation.
It took me six and a half minutes for giving my
presentation.
The feedback I received was, that I could use the
additional one and a half minutes I have at my disposal on
the actual presentation to go into further detail on how
I plan to overcome the challenges.
Also I downplayed too much the challenges I will face, so
it sounded like I underestimate the dissertation project.
The slides were deemed fine.
