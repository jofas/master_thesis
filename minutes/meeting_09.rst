Discussion
----------

Update on how my work is getting along. The Log section will describe
what happened and what I did last week.
Had to readjust my work plan but it is minor and I'm still confident
I can reach my expectations bearing unforseeable complications.


Log
---

* Implemented the injection of data onto the SpiNNaker board with the
  `ReverseIpTagMulitcastSource` vertex. I got the communication with
  the host machine worked out now. I can start to work on the MLP
  forward pass (inference) this week.

* Started working on the introduction to my dissertation paper. Took
  me longer than expected/I was quite thorough and very careful about
  my wording and my structure.

* Spend time reading up on SpiNNaker, neuromorphic computing and how
  it is already used for deep learning.
