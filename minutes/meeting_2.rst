Discussion
----------

The focus of the meeting was a dry-run of my presentation.
It took me six and a half minutes for the presentation.
While overall the feedback was positive, Caoimhín and Alan
found a few points that I could optimize:

* No pictures, just bullet points

* Spend more time on explaining the difference between
  deep neural networks and spiking neural networks
  (the former is used for image recognition,
  classification, text generation, autonomous driving,
  etc., the latter for modeling the human brain
  (neuroscience))

* How do I intent to prepare myself? (minimize every effort
  not put into programming, be precise on what layers I
  need to implement for the benchmark, so I won't start
  spending too much effort on unnecessary features)

After receiving the feedback, Alan and I discussed some
thoughts of mine on how I want to implement batches on
spinnaker.
Alan reassured me, that my ideas will work.
