Discussion
----------

Kick-off meeting for the dissertation phase. Caoimhín informed me
about some general information at the beginning. He told me about the
marking scheme and what is expected from me during the dissertation
phase. He emphasized that the dissertation paper will be the most
important part of my marking to enusure that I will keep this in mind
while I work on my program.

Afterwards I told them how I intend to go forward with my work.
I will spend this week planning the architecture of my program/library
to an extend where I can go on implementing without having to diverge
too much from the general plan. This allows me to better plan my time
and better estimate how the work progresses.

Lastly we discussed my day-to-day routine. I will try sticking to a
40 hour work-week where I will try to work from 9am - 12pm and
3pm - 7pm GMT+1. This again was approved by all.
