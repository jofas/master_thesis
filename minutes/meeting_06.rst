Discussion
----------

Short meeting where we tested the remote setup for future meetings.
For now we decided Skype fits well.
No concrete date for a next meeting was set, but probably in May
after my exams we will have the next offical meeting.
In the meantime I can contact everybody either by mail or over Skype.
