Discussion
----------

The focus of the meeting was to present the state of my
work done so far for this project.
We began by discussing my outline of the goal of this
project.
Afterwards we looked at the abstraction level of the
graph we want to run on spinnaker (low level linear algebra
operations (tensorflow) vs. high level conceptual graph
(keras)).
Everybody was OK with me to explore this topic further.

After presenting my ambition to use the high level
conceptual graph instead of the low level linear algebra
one, Alan pointed out to me, that a the Nengo simulator
has a backend for spinnaker, which could be similar to
my pledged approach.

We finished the meeting by defining the next steps,
which will be, that I continue figuring out how I will
approach the dissertation, followed by experimenting with
programming spinnaker.
Afterwards I can better estimate time constraints and
tasks I will have to do.
