Discussion
----------

Update on how my work is getting along. The Log section will describe
what happened and what I did last week.
Unfortunately I forgot some detail of implementation and the timetable
is getting tighter. Next week I will know if I can manage the original
benchmark. If not I have enough to write my dissertation about.
